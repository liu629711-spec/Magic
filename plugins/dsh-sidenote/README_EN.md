## Install

Prerequisite: [dsh-better-sidebar](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/DSH-better-sidebar) (hard dependency).

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-sidenote
```

Three steps: **①** install the dependency → **②** install this plugin → **③** click "Side" in the session header, or just select any reply text.

For local development, mount with `dsh plugin --profile web add link:<repo path>` (client changes hot-reload; host changes need a `dsh web` restart).

## Side chat — side questions never derail the main thread

**Fork** the current session (full history snapshot, no compression) into an independent side session living in the right-hand panel:

- Three entries — header "Side" button, the `+` menu, the `/side` slash command — and multiple instances side by side;
- **The same rendering material as the main chat**: tool cards, thinking previews, task cards, model/permission switching, `@` references, image attachments;
- Answer approvals and questions **right inside the panel** — no jumping back to the main view; a toast lets you know when a reply lands;
- Inherited history folds into a summary card; fold and scroll state survive reloads; `Alt+J` hops focus between main and side.

## Selection annotations — turn "this bit is off" into model context

- Select text in an assistant reply → popover → note editor, with numbered badges anchored at the right gutter;
- Annotations are controlled objects (preview, remove individually) with **zero draft pollution** — they serialize into a model-readable structured protocol block only at send time;
- Sent bubbles collapse into a "×N annotated" trace label; everything survives reloads.

## Reflow — side-lane findings come home

- One click sends a side-chat conclusion back to the main session as a **Q&A pair** (the answer *and* the question it answers) — a controlled chip above the main composer that rides along with your next message; `@`-mentioning a side chat works too;
- "Save as session" promotes a side chat into the session list; recently closed ones reopen from the `/side` popup.

## Compatibility

| DSH | dsh-better-sidebar | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1.1-rc.x | ≥ 0.12.3 | ✅ dual-lane CI matrix |
| 0.1.2-rc.x | ≥ 0.18.0 | ✅ dual-lane CI matrix |

A weekly canary tracks new host releases; when a host capability is absent, the plugin degrades by capability instead of crashing.

## Design notes

- **A real fork, not a summary**: the side session is a genuine DSH session (full history snapshot) with the same capabilities as the main one — not a one-shot Q&A.
- **List hygiene**: side sessions are archived out of the session list; your list stays clean.
- **An accumulative annotation workflow**: select repeatedly, stack notes, edit, remove, send them together — not a one-off quote.

## Development

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm typecheck` | tsc --noEmit |
| `pnpm test` | vitest unit tests (136 cases) |
| `pnpm build` | type declarations + tsdown (host ESM + client CJS bundle, purity gates) |
| `pnpm test:mount` | mount smoke: real `dsh web` + fabricated session log + ten Playwright journey lanes (`BS_VERSION`/`DSH_CMD` version matrix) |
