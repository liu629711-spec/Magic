A **DeepSeek Harness** appearance plugin that lets you fully customize the Web UI — custom theme color, background wallpaper, and fine-grained per-part opacity & blur controls.

## Features

- **PS-style Color Wheel** — Pick hue on the ring, adjust saturation & lightness in the inscribed square. Generates 30+ CSS design tokens in real time.
- **Precise HSL / RGB Input** — Enter exact color values numerically with instant bidirectional sync to the wheel.
- **Smart Color Extraction** — One click derives a theme color from your wallpaper by sampling the visible region, quantizing, and filtering out gray / near-black / near-white pixels. Video wallpapers contribute via an auto-captured frame. Fully client-side.
- **Eyedropper** — Hover the wallpaper to preview a color and click to pick it as the theme color.
- **Background Wallpaper** — Upload any image as your wallpaper. Drag to pan and scroll to zoom inside a viewport-proportional editor.
- **Video Wallpaper** — Use a video as a live wallpaper: muted looping playback that survives refreshes (file persistence + HTTP streaming with Range seek), with an auto-captured frame powering the preview, theme-color extraction, and the position editor.
- **Position Editor** — One shared editor for images and videos: drag to pan, scroll to zoom, one-click reset. Image and video placements are stored separately and never overwrite each other.
- **Layout Modes** — Fit / Fill / Stretch / Tile / Center for both images and videos; in Fit mode the editor-committed framing stays consistent across window resizes and cross-monitor moves.
- **Generated Dynamic Backgrounds** — Choose mesh gradient, Shader, or geometric patterns with adjustable spread, intensity, and seed locking.
- **Per-part Interface Opacity** — Independent sliders for the main background, sidebar, cards & panels (including the dropdowns and menus around the dialog), the input & controls (composer box, Cordis panel), plus the settings panel and wallpaper.
- **Per-part Interface Blur** — Frosted-glass `backdrop-filter` blur (0–60 px) for each interface part, including a real backdrop on the composer and Cordis panel via stable host selectors.
- **Conversation View Cards** — The message list is wrapped in a translucent card automatically, and the trajectory page gets whole-page opacity & blur controls, letting the wallpaper shine through the content.
- **Theme Export / Import** — One-click export to a self-contained `dsh-any-theme.json` (config + wallpaper, video embedded as a data URL) and import to restore it anywhere.
- **File-based Persistence** — All settings are stored on the filesystem under `~/.dsh/.dsh-any-background-data/`, not `localStorage`.
- **Bilingual** — Full Chinese / English UI with automatic locale detection.
- **Theme Watchdog** — Re-asserts the custom theme if the host resets it.

## Recent Optimizations

### v0.2.4

- **dsh 0.1.5 persistence fixed** — The theme/wallpaper RPC channel is now registered directly in the plugin's own `webServer` scope as a prefix route (keeping the same Host/Origin auth fence), instead of through `connection.rpc.handle`, whose effect binds to the connection service's context and never mounted on some 0.1.5 hosts — requests that previously dropped to the SPA fallback with 405 and never reached the disk now persist again. Verified working on both 0.1.2 and 0.1.5.
- **Host compatibility declared** — Added `engines.dsh: ">=0.1.2-rc.1"` to declare which DeepSeek Harness host versions the plugin supports.
- **Dark badge tokens fixed (issue #9)** — In the dark preset, the `*-tertiary` badge surfaces (trajectory tool/context badges, connection pill, plan chip) were tinted nearly the same as their background, making light label text unreadable. They now use the native dark 800/900 steps, so bright text sits on a properly dark badge.

### v0.2.3

- **Wide tables stay in the column** — When the chat region opacity/blur is raised (which makes the chat border visible), wide markdown tables are pulled back inside the text column and scroll horizontally at the border instead of bleeding past it. Left untouched while the border is invisible, preserving DSH's default behavior.
- **Network URL wallpaper** — Paste an image URL and the plugin downloads it and writes it to the local wallpaper file (replacing the previous image). Because the remote source lands as a local persisted file, theme export/import keep working with no extra steps: an exported theme embeds the image data, and the receiving side never needs access to the original URL.
- **Editor confirm button visible in dark mode** — The background-editor "Confirm" button now matches the Cancel/Reset buttons (solid surface with a clear frame and legible label) instead of a translucent primary tint, so it no longer disappears in dark themes.
- **Maintenance cleanup** — Removed an unused `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-renderer` entry from the client inject list and aligned self-owned RPC error codes with the new harness convention.

## Installation

### Method 1: npm install (Recommended)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Tkingxiao/dsh-any-background
# or, if published to the registry:
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-any-background
```

Then launch:

```sh
dsh web
```

The plugin appears as a **"Theme"** section in Settings.

### Method 2: npx (No Global Install)

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add github:Tkingxiao/dsh-any-background
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

### Method 3: Local Build (Development)

The `lib/` directory is committed, so installs need no build step. To rebuild after editing `src/`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tkingxiao/dsh-any-background.git
cd dsh-any-background
pnpm install
pnpm run bundle
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add "dsh-any-background"
pnpm dsh web
```

## Compatibility

- **[`dsh web`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)** — Full support on both the npm release and the new source build. The plugin auto-detects which client-module table the host ships (the new `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-store` or the legacy `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime`) and resolves `defineStore` accordingly at runtime.
- **[deepseek-harness-desktop](https://github.com/anywhere-labs/deepseek-harness-desktop)** — Supported
